This is the model and appendix files for Tianyi Zhang's thesis "Application of A System Dynamic Model on U.S. Regional Real Estate Industry"
Two folders are included. First is the model used for calibration, which contains the following:
	“Real Estate V2.mdl”: the model.
	“Data V6.vdfx”: the dataset used for calibration.
	“C2V0.voc”: optimization control including parameters range and optimization settings
	“DataV5 C1.vpd”: the payoff function.
	“C 0321.out”: the calibration result
Second is the model and data used for forecasting, which contains the following:
	“Real Estate V2 Forecast.mdl”: the model.
	“Fdata V1.vdfx”, “Fdata V2.vdfx”, “Fdata V3.vdfx”: datasets used for forecasting simulations, representing forecast 1, forecast 2 and forecast 3 respectively.
	“Forecast 1.vdfx”, “Forecast 2.vdfx”, “Forecast 3.vdfx”: simulation results, generated by running model with datasets above.
	“C 0321.out”: the calibration result, the same as above
	“Data V6.vdfx”: the dataset used for calibration and also as benchmark for those forecasts
